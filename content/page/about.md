Aloha! My name is Mark Chua. This is my personal page. All views and opinions are owned solely by myself; none of them is related to the organization that I am affiliated with. 

I have the following interests: 

- Technology: the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning. 

- Finance: investment. 

- Philosophy: the fundamental understanding of human knowledge in the context of machine learning and human learning, and their continuous combination.

My background encompasses a blend of experiences(well, maybe a bit of expertise if you are willing to call it): 
- Electrical and computer engineer by training - I do have an engineer ring and a P.Eng designation.

- Bread and butter of work: data, code and ideas, and sometimes people and processes as ingredients. 

- Types of work: software engineering, cybersecurity analyst and researcher, a bit of university teacher
