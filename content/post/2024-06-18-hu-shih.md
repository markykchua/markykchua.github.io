In the [Hu Shih Memorial Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hu+Shih+Memorial+Hall/@25.0405722,121.6161889,17z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x3442ab45774e808b:0xa3354dbc17c3f3b2!2sHu+Shih+Memorial+Hall!8m2!3d25.0405722!4d121.6161889!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1tdn1sl6!3m5!1s0x3442ab45774e808b:0xa3354dbc17c3f3b2!8m2!3d25.0405722!4d121.6161889!16s%2Fg%2F1tdn1sl6?entry=ttu) in Taipei, Republic of China, there is a stone tablet is engraved with a famous saying by the philosopher. 

![Hu Shih's quote](/images/hu_shih.png)

If you allow, I would translate it as ```For the making of knowledge, you must be doubtful where you are not doubtful; and for the dealing with people, you must not be doubtful where you are doubtful.``` Among the traditional Chinese scholars, ```the making of knowledge(做學問)``` is essentially their life-time mission. This aligns with modern approach of doing research as well. And in the modern approach, it also requires the communication and collaboration with others for the generation of knowledge. 

However, as someone who is a far observer of some research community, it seems that some academics put too much weight on ```marketing``` instead of the making of knowledge. Evident of this includes the publication of so-called academic papers for the sake of publication and the increasing number of PhD students going through the assembly line orchestrated by professors who are essentially money managers of grants. I am not trying to blame on anyone for anything. Instead, I full comprehend the importance of making a living. However, it will not be sustainable. At the end of day, the making of knowledge is why academic research is needed. 

What can a "research" paper is of nothing but marketing materials be called? It is not academics(學術), it is incompetent(不學無術). 

Disclaimer: this article is just for the entertainment of people who can recognize the difference from 學術 to 不學無術 is not too far.
