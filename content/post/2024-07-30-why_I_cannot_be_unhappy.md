Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a little girl named Lily. Lily was a cheerful and lively child, always seen with a smile on her face. 

But one day, something unusual happened. Lily was found sitting on a swing in the park, tears streaming down her face. Concerned, her mother, Mrs. Johnson, rushed over and asked, "Lily, what's wrong? Why are you crying?" Through her sobs, Lily managed to utter, ``"Why can't I be unhappy, Mommy?"`` 

Surprised by her daughter's question, Mrs. Johnson sat down next to Lily on the swing. She gently wiped away her tears and said, "Oh, sweetheart, of course you can be unhappy. It's okay to feel sad sometimes. But I'm just curious, what makes you say that?" Lily sniffled and replied, "Well, Mommy, everyone always expects me to be happy. They say I'm such a cheerful girl, but sometimes I don't feel happy inside. And when I cry, people act like it's something strange." 

Mrs. Johnson understood her daughter's dilemma. She realized that Lily was questioning the expectations placed upon her to always be happy. With a reassuring smile, she said, "Lily, being happy all the time is impossible, even for adults. We all have ups and downs, moments of joy and moments of sadness. It's a normal part of life." 

Lily looked up at her mother, her big blue eyes filled with curiosity. "Really, Mommy? Even grown-ups feel unhappy sometimes?" Mrs. Johnson nodded. "Absolutely, sweetheart. Sometimes we have bad days or things don't go the way we want them to. It's perfectly fine to feel sad or cry when that happens." Lily pondered for a moment, her tears slowly subsiding. 

Then she asked, "But Mommy, why do people act like it's strange when I cry? Shouldn't they understand?" Mrs. Johnson took a deep breath, realizing that this was an important lesson for her daughter. "Well, Lily, sometimes people don't know how to react when someone they see as always happy suddenly shows vulnerability. It might make them uncomfortable because they're used to seeing you in a different light." Lily nodded, absorbing her mother's words. "So, Mommy, what should I do when I feel sad?" Mrs. Johnson hugged Lily tightly and replied, "When you feel sad, my dear, it's important to express your emotions. You can talk to me, your friends, or even write about it in your diary. Remember, it's okay to ask for support and comfort when you need it." Lily smiled, a mixture of relief and understanding spreading across her face. She realized that being genuinely happy didn't mean hiding her true feelings. 

From that day on, Lily learned to embrace all her emotions and express herself freely. And so, as the days went by, Lily continued to be the cheerful girl everyone knew her to be, but now with the added knowledge that it was okay for her to feel unhappy sometimes. She no longer felt the need to hide her tears or question her own emotions, for she understood that being true to herself was the most important thing of all.
